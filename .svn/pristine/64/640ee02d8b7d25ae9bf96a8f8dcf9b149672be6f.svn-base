\title{Fit binomial GLM}
\usage{
fitSAGLM(data, formula, terms, pseudocount = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{object of sajr class, produced by \code{\link{loadSAData}}}

\item{formula}{object returned by \code{\link{terms}} function. Should be in form of x ~ sum_of_factors}

\item{terms}{list with values of factors used in formula}

\item{pseudocount}{proportion of total (inclusion + exclusion) reads that will be added to both inclusion and exclusion counts to evide overfitting}
}
\value{
list of glm objects
}
\description{
Fit GLM model with binomial distribution for each supplied segments
}
\examples{
mod = list(brain_reg=factor(c('pfc','pfc','cbc','cbc')),age=factor(c('nb','adult','nb','adult')))
alt.glm = fitGLM(seg.filtered,terms(x ~ brain_reg + age,keep.order=T),mod,0.05)

\title{Calculates length of constitutive part of gene}
\usage{
calcGeneConstLength(segs, with_first_last)
}
\arguments{
\item{segs}{output of loadSAData function}

\item{with_first_last}{should constitutive last of first segment (if any) be used. This
option should be used in agreement with count_only_internal option of SAJR read counter}
}
\value{
vector of lengths
}
\description{
It could be used to normalize gene read counts to calculate [FR]PKM
}

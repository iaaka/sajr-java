TODO
clustSegs need to be improved: missing data

===================================================
Change log.
* denotes corrections of mistake (functions didn't work (at least in some cases) prior to cerrection)
# denotes corrections that change returned results of functions
  denotes not important corrections

===released===
2013.09.20* - corrections in calcSAPvalue: dispersion parameter now estimated by summary.glm, plus corrected p-value calculation: previously if there were too few observations that factor has 0 freedoms it resulted in p-value=0 (because chisq with df=0 and s>0 is always 0). Now p-value calculated by anova function.
2013.09.20  - corrections in fitSAGLM: creates list of necessary size at begining: should work faster

2013.05.08# - improve clustSegs function
===released===
2013.04.28* - functions calcSAPvalue and fitSAGLM: previously it takes term names from first GLM fit, but it could be NULL.
2013.04.26* - function clustSegs: had link (in function declaration) to undeclared variable; Improved normalization
===released===
2013.04.25* - function makeGAlts: mistake in part where alternative coordinates were set in case of negative strand.
2013.04.25  - help for clustSegs functions, hlcuts -> hclust 
2013.04.24  - change help for makeAlts functions (seg should have 'site' coulumn), and add check for this into function.

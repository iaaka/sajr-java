\title{Splits genes into splicing alternatives}
\usage{
makeAlts(seg, ann.gff, remove.exn.ext = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{seg}{segment anbnotation (first element of output of loadSAData function)}

\item{ann.gff}{name of gff file}

\item{remove.exn.ext}{specifies whether alternative TSS/polyA that aren't supplied by alternative splicing should be considered}
}
\value{
data.frame with all found alternatives.
sites is types of splicing sites: [a]cceptor and [d]onor
segs is list of alternative segments separated by ';'. Each segment is denoted by ranks of splice sites that form segment's boundaries, rank == NA correspons to alternative TSS or polyA
ints the same as segs but for introns
}
\description{
Cuts genes by constitutive segments into regions that
can be spliced alternatively
